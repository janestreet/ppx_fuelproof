synopsis: "Get better error messages and improve mode crossing for types"
description: "
ppx_fuelproof helps work around several issues when trying to make your
type mode-cross in the way you want:

  1. It generates better error messages when your type doesn't mode-cross.
  2. It helps you avoid running out of fuel. (The mode-crossing check in
     the compiler limits how hard it will try to prove mode-crossing.)
  3. It lets you have some amount of mode-crossing GADTs.
