`ppx_fuelproof` raises an error if it would cause existential variables to have more
restrictive mode crossing behavior inferred for them.

You can explicitly quantify the variables to help:

```ocaml
type%fuelproof t : value mod portable =
  | A : ('a : value mod portable). 'a -> t
  | B : ('a : value mod portable). 'a list   -> t
  | C : ('a : value mod portable). 'a iarray -> t
```

Error: Bad layout annotation:
         The kind of float is value mod many unyielding stateless immutable

         But the kind of float must be a subkind of
             any mod many unyielding stateless immutable non_float
