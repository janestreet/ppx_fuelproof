Error on type without kind annotation:

`ppx_fuelproof` can cause existential variables to have
more restrictive mode crossing behavior inferred for them.

```ocaml
type%fuelproof t : value mod portable =
  | A : _        -> t
  | B : _ list   -> t
  | C : _ iarray -> t
```

You can't fill in the existential variables with a function:

```ocaml
# A (fun () -> ());;
Line 1, characters 3-17:
Error:
       The kind of 'a -> 'b is value mod aliased immutable non_float
         because it's a function type.
       But the kind of 'a -> 'b must be a subkind of value mod portable
         because of the definition of t at lines 1-4, characters 1-24.
# B [ (fun () -> ()) ];;
Line 1, characters 5-19:
Error:
       The kind of 'a -> 'b is value mod aliased immutable non_float
         because it's a function type.
       But the kind of 'a -> 'b must be a subkind of value mod portable
         because of the definition of t at lines 1-4, characters 1-24.
# C [: (fun () -> ()) :];;
Line 1, characters 6-20:
Error:
       The kind of 'a -> 'b is value mod aliased immutable non_float

Errors on missing kind annotations on `[@@unboxed]` types:

```ocaml
type%fuelproof t = { inner : string * int } [@@unboxed]
```
```mdx-error
Line 1, characters 1-56:
Error: %fuelproof can only be written on types with kind annotations

Errors on claiming that a float isn't:

```ocaml
type%fuelproof t : immutable_data = { x : float } [@@unboxed]
```
```mdx-error
Line 1, characters 43-48:
Error: Bad layout annotation:
         The kind of float is value mod many unyielding stateless immutable
           because it is the primitive type float.
         But the kind of float must be a subkind of
             any mod many unyielding stateless immutable non_float
           because of the annotation on the wildcard _ at line 1, characters 43-48.
