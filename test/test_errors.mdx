`ppx_fuelproof` can cause existential variables to have
more restrictive mode crossing behavior inferred for them.

```ocaml
type%fuelproof t : value mod portable =
  | A : _        -> t
  | B : _ list   -> t
  | C : _ iarray -> t
```

You can't fill in the existential variables with a function:

```ocaml
# A (fun () -> ());;
Line 1, characters 3-17:
Error:
       The kind of 'a -> 'b is value mod aliased immutable non_float
         because it's a function type.
       But the kind of 'a -> 'b must be a subkind of value mod portable
         because of the definition of t at lines 1-4, characters 1-24.
# B [ (fun () -> ()) ];;
Line 1, characters 5-19:
Error:

       But the kind of 'a -> 'b must be a subkind of value mod portable
         because of the definition of t at lines 1-4, characters 1-24.
# C [: (fun () -> ()) :];;
Line 1, characters 6-20:

Errors on missing kind annotations on `[@@unboxed]` types:
